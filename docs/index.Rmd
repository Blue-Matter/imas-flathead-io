### Life history chracteristics

In order to include plausible uncertainty in the life-history dynamics for sand flathead, frequentist models of somatic growth and the length-weight relationship were fitted to data and parameter values draw from the variance covariance matrix arising from those fits (Figures 2 and 3)

Top left is the fit of a preliminary von Bertalanffy somatic growth model to observed age-length data.  Top right is the correlation among simulated asympotic length (Linf) and maximum growth rate (K) parameters drawn from the variance-covariance matrix of the model fit. Bottom left is the simualted natual mortality rate (M) given a fixed ratio of M/K and a lognormal error with CV of 10%. Bottom right is the simulated length at 50% maturity (L50) given a fixed ratio of L50/Linf and a lognormal error with CV of 10%.

&nbsp;


The mean 'maturity' (fraction of individuals mature) ogive was calculated from the historical data (all regions combined, Figure 4a) and was the basis for simulating correlated uncertainty in L50 (length at 50% maturity) in Figure 2. A very different maturity ogive is provided by the more recent fishery independent survey (all regional combined, Figure 4b).

### Appendix 1: MSE terminology

### Operating models 

An operating model is a theoretical description of fishery and population dynamics used for the testing of management strategies that could include, for example,  data collection protocols, stock assessment methods, harvest control rules, enforcement policies and reference points. In fisheries, operating models are used in closed-loop simulation to test management procedures (aka. harvest strategy) accounting for feedbacks between the system, data, management procedure and implementation. A management procedure is any codifable rule that calculates management advice from data. Management Strategy Evaluation uses closed-loop simulation of management procedures as a core technical component but is a wider process of stakeholder and manager engagement that identifies system uncertainties, performance metrics, viable management procedures, ultimately aiming to adopt an MP for the provision of management advice for an established time period. 

&nbsp;

#### Reference Case Operating Models

The reference case operating model is used as the single 'base' operating model from which reference set and robustness set operating models are specified. Reference and robustness tests are typically 1-factor departures from the reference case OM, however sometimes reference set OMs are organized in a factorial grid across primary axes of uncertainty. 

&nbsp;

#### Reference Set Operating Models

Reference set operating models span a plausible range of the core uncertainties for states of nature. These are often the types of alternative parameterizations or assumptions that would be included in a stock assessment sensitivity analysis. 

The role of the reference set operating models is to provide the central basis for evaluating the performance of candidate management procedures, for example rejecting badly performing harvest strategies. 

&nbsp;

#### Robustness Set Operating Models

Robustness set operating models are intended to include additional sources of uncertainty for providing further discrimination among management procedures that perform comparably among reference set operating models. 

Robustness operating models often represent system states of nature that are not empirically informed or are hypotheses of a subset of stakeholders.
